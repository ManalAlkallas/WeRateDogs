# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling Project

**WeRateDogs** is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
</br>
The dataset that I am going to  wrangle (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates),
also known as [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).

- The required softwares:
    1. Jupyter Notebook
    2. The required packages (libraries) need to be installed. 
        - pandas
        - NumPy
        - requests
        - tweepy
        - json
    3. A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
